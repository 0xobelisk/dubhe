# 🚀 Dubhe CI/CD Workflow Documentation

## 📋 Workflow Overview

### 🔄 Unified Release Process (`unified-release.yml`)

**Primary release workflow** - Automatically triggered when version tags are pushed

**Features:**

- ✅ Unified update of all project versions (Rust + Node.js)
- ✅ Build cross-platform Rust binaries
- ✅ Build and publish NPM packages
- ✅ Create GitHub Release
- ✅ Automatic binary testing

**Trigger method:**

```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

### 🧪 Dubhe Move Tests (`dubhe-move-tests.yml`)

Move test workflow for `framework/src/dubhe` with explicit and reproducible gas limits.

**Features:**

- ✅ Separate pipelines:
  - `test-fast` (smoke set: address/dapp_system)
  - `test-audit` (full suite)
- ✅ Quality gates in `test-audit`:
  - gas regression gate vs baseline (`framework/src/dubhe/.ci/move-gas-baseline.json`)
  - coverage gate (`make coverage-gate`, threshold via `SUI_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD_PCT`)
  - fuzz smoke (`make fuzz-smoke`)
  - quality trend gate (`make quality-trend`, baseline: `framework/src/dubhe/.ci/move-quality-baseline.json`)
- ✅ Fixed gas limits in CI env:
  - `SUI_TEST_GAS_LIMIT_FAST=200000000`
  - `SUI_TEST_GAS_LIMIT_AUDIT=500000000`
- ✅ Pinned Sui CLI version in CI (resolved from `framework/src/dubhe/Move.toml` `rev`)
- ✅ Runs through Makefile entrypoints (`make test-fast` / `make test-audit`)
- ✅ Supports PR, push to `main`, and manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`)
- ✅ Includes a stable gate job: `dubhe-move-required` (safe for branch protection required check)
- ✅ Uploads CI artifacts for audit replay:
  - `test-fast` log
  - `test-audit` log + `framework/src/dubhe/traces`
  - quality trend log + rendered audit report (`framework/src/dubhe/.reports/move-audit-report.md`)

**Branch protection recommendation (GitHub required checks):**

- Set `dubhe-move-required` as required check.
- Keep `test-fast` / `test-audit` as informative jobs.
- This avoids blocking unrelated PRs, because non-Dubhe changes are auto-marked as skipped by workflow logic while gate still reports success.

## 🎯 Advantage Comparison

### ✅ Current Solution

```
Tag Push → unified-release.yml → Sequential execution of all release steps
```

**Core Advantages:**

- 🚫 **Eliminate Conflicts**: Single workflow avoids concurrent pushes
- 🔄 **Sequential Execution**: Version update → Build → Release → Test
- 📦 **Unified Management**: All release content managed in one place
- 🧪 **Automatic Testing**: Auto-test binaries after building

## 📝 Usage Guide

### Release New Version

```bash
# 1. Ensure code is merged to main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create and push version tag
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3

# 3. Monitor release progress in GitHub Actions
# https://github.com/0xobelisk/dubhe/actions
```

### Check Release Status

- Visit [Actions page](../../actions)
- Look for "Unified Release Process" workflow
- Monitor execution status of each step

### After Release Completion

- 📦 NPM packages will be published to npmjs.com
- 📁 Binary files will be uploaded to GitHub Releases
- 📋 Detailed release notes will be auto-generated

## 🔧 Maintenance Instructions

### Adding New NPM Packages

Add to the following locations in `unified-release.yml`:

1. Version update in `update-versions` step
2. Build and publish in `build-and-publish-npm` step

### Adding New Platform Support

Add new platform configuration in `build-rust` `matrix`

### Emergency Handling

For urgent release of specific components:

1. Manually trigger disabled workflows
2. Or temporarily enable automatic triggering of corresponding workflows

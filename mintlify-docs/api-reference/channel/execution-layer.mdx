# Channel Execution Layer

The Dubhe Channel execution layer provides high-performance off-chain computation capabilities while maintaining on-chain security and finality.

## Coming Soon

The execution layer APIs are currently in development. This documentation will cover:

### Core Execution APIs
- Computation scheduling and management
- State channel lifecycle operations
- Result verification and settlement
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Integration Interfaces
- WebSocket real-time communication
- Batch operation processing
- Cross-layer state synchronization
- Error handling and recovery

<Note>
**Alpha Release**: Channel execution layer APIs will be available in Q2 2024. Early access available for development partners.
</Note>

## Architecture Preview

The execution layer will provide:

- **High-throughput processing**: 10,000+ operations per second
- **Low-latency execution**: Sub-second response times
- **Secure computation**: Cryptographic proof mechanisms
- **Seamless integration**: Direct compatibility with Dubhe Engine

# Dubhe Channel API

Dubhe Channel provides high-performance off-chain execution capabilities with on-chain settlement, enabling complex computations that scale beyond blockchain limitations.

## Overview

Dubhe Channel operates as a Layer 2 solution that:

- **Executes complex logic off-chain** for performance
- **Settles results on-chain** for security and finality
- **Maintains state consistency** between layers
- **Provides real-time execution** for gaming and interactive applications

## Coming Soon

The Dubhe Channel API documentation is currently in development. This will include:

### Execution Engine APIs
- State channel management
- Computation scheduling and execution
- Result verification and settlement

### Client Integration
- TypeScript SDK for frontend applications
- WebSocket APIs for real-time communication
- Batch operation support

### State Management
- Channel state synchronization
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Rollback and recovery procedures

## Technical Specifications

Based on the [Dubhe Channel Technical Whitepaper](/whitepaper/dubhe-channel-technical-whitepaper), the API will support:

- **High Throughput**: 10,000+ TPS execution capacity
- **Low Latency**: Sub-second state updates
- **Composability**: Integration with Dubhe Engine contracts
- **Security**: Cryptographic proof mechanisms

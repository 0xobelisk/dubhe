# DubheOS System Calls

DubheOS provides a complete blockchain operating system with unified interfaces for resource management, process control, and system integration.

## Overview

DubheOS system calls enable applications to:

- **Manage computational resources** across the Dubhe stack
- **Control application lifecycle** and process scheduling
- **Access shared services** and system utilities
- **Integrate with external systems** through standardized interfaces

## Coming Soon

The DubheOS API documentation is in active development. This will include:

### Core System Calls
- Process management and scheduling
- Memory and storage allocation
- Network and communication interfaces
- Security and permission management

### Resource Management
- Computational resource allocation
- Storage and data management
- Network bandwidth control
- Gas and fee optimization

### Application Lifecycle
- Application deployment and configuration
- Runtime environment management
- Service discovery and registration
- Health monitoring and diagnostics

## Technical Architecture

Based on the [DubheOS Technical Whitepaper](/whitepaper/dubhe-os-technical-whitepaper), the system provides:

- **Unified Resource Model**: Abstract interfaces for diverse blockchain resources
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Standardized APIs across different networks
- **Developer Experience**: High-level abstractions for complex operations
- **Performance Optimization**: Intelligent resource allocation and caching

## System Requirements

DubheOS applications will support:

- **Multi-Network Deployment**: Sui, Ethereum, and other EVM chains
- **Resource Scaling**: Dynamic allocation based on demand
- **Service Integration**: Built-in support for common Web3 services
- **Developer Tools**: Comprehensive SDK and debugging capabilities

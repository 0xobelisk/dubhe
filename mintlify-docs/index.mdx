# What's Dubhe Engine?

Dubhe Engine is a Open-source, high-performance engine for real-time Fully On-Chain Move apps.

## Overview

Dubhe Engine is a developer-friendly Move application engine focused on building high-performance, real-time fully on-chain applications. Applications built with Dubhe Engine are inherently composable, extensible, permissionless, and persistent. By leveraging Dubhe Engine, developers can significantly reduce the complexity and cost of building Move applications, helping create a fully on-chain world centered around user intent.

As a vital addition to the Move ecosystem, Dubhe Engine provides developers with a complete production-grade solution. It enables building, deploying, and upgrading Move applications on infrastructure networks like Sui, achieving scalable on-chain computation while maintaining Move's security properties.

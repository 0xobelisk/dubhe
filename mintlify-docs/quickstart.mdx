## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

<Tip>
  Dubhe uses the **Entity Component System (ECS)** pattern - the same architecture powering AAA game engines like Unity DOTS and Unreal Engine
</Tip>

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Entities" icon="circle" color="#667eea">
    **Unique identifiers** for objects in your application world
  </Card>
  <Card title="Components" icon="cube" color="#764ba2">
    **Data containers** that store entity attributes and state
  </Card>
  <Card title="Systems" icon="gears" color="#f59e0b">
    **Logic processors** that transform component data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Accordion title="Why ECS Architecture?">
  ECS provides several advantages for on-chain applications:
  
  - **Performance**: Data-oriented design optimizes for cache efficiency
  - **Flexibility**: Mix and match components to create complex behaviors
  - **Modularity**: Systems are independent and composable
  - **Scalability**: Easily handle thousands of entities
</Accordion>

## üíª Development Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design Your Schema">

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Schema Definition">
        ```javascript
        // dubhe.config.js
        export default {
          schemas: {
            components: [
              {
                name: "PlayerComponent",
                fields: {
                  health: "u64",
                  level: "u8",
                  experience: "u64",
                  name: "string"
                }
              },
              {
                name: "InventoryComponent", 
                fields: {
                  items: "vector<ItemId>",
                  capacity: "u32"
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Generated Move Code">
        ```move
        module game::player_component {
          struct PlayerComponent has store, drop {
            health: u64,
            level: u8,
            experience: u64,
            name: String
          }
          
          public fun new(...): PlayerComponent { ... }
          public fun get_health(...): u64 { ... }
          public fun set_health(...) { ... }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="TypeScript SDK">
        ```typescript
        interface PlayerComponent {
          health: bigint;
          level: number;
          experience: bigint;
          name: string;
        }
        
        const player = await client.getComponent<PlayerComponent>(
          'PlayerComponent',
          entityId
        );
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate Move Contracts">
    Use the CLI to generate type-safe Move code:
    
    ```bash
    dubhe generate
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implement Systems">
    Write game logic in Move:
    
    ```move
    public entry fun level_up(player: &mut PlayerComponent) {
        assert!(player.experience >= required_exp(player.level), EInsufficientExp);
        player.level = player.level + 1;
        player.experience = 0;
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build Frontend">
    Connect your UI with the TypeScript client:
    
    ```typescript
    const playerData = await client.getComponent({
      entity: playerId,
      component: 'PlayerComponent'
    });
    
    await client.tx.player_system.level_up({ player: playerId });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

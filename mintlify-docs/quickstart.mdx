# Developer Guide

Learn how to build, deploy, and scale fully on-chain applications using Dubhe Engine - the powerful Move framework for real-time blockchain applications.

## What is Dubhe Engine?

Dubhe Engine is an open-source, high-performance framework for building real-time fully on-chain Move applications. It provides:

- **Entity Component System (ECS)** architecture for scalable game logic
- **Type-safe schemas** for data modeling and validation  
- **Real-time synchronization** between on-chain state and clients
- **Developer-friendly tooling** with CLI and TypeScript SDK

## Core Architecture

Dubhe Engine applications are built around three main concepts:

  <Card title="Entities" icon="circle">
    Game objects that exist in your world
  </Card>
  <Card title="Components" icon="cube">
    Data containers that define entity properties
  </Card>
  <Card title="Systems" icon="gears">
    Logic functions that operate on components
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Development Workflow

### 1. Design Your Schema

Define the data structure for your application:

```javascript
// dubhe.config.js
export default {
  schemas: {
    components: [
      {
        name: "PlayerComponent",
        fields: {
          health: "u64",
          level: "u8",
          experience: "u64"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Generate Move Contracts

Use the CLI to generate type-safe Move code:

```bash
dubhe generate
```

### 3. Implement Systems

Write game logic in Move:

```move
public entry fun level_up(player: &mut PlayerComponent) {
    assert!(player.experience >= required_exp(player.level), EInsufficientExp);
    player.level = player.level + 1;
    player.experience = 0;
}
```

### 4. Build Frontend

Connect your UI with the TypeScript client:

```typescript
const playerData = await client.getComponent({
  entity: playerId,
  component: 'PlayerComponent'
});

await client.tx.player_system.level_up({ player: playerId });
```

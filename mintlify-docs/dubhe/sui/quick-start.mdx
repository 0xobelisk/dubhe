# Quick Start with Dubhe Engine

Get up and running with Dubhe Engine to build your first fully on-chain Move application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Sui CLI](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

Install the Dubhe CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @0xobelisk/dubhe-cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
dubhe --version
```

## Create Your First Project

1. **Initialize a new Dubhe project:**

```bash
dubhe create my-first-game
cd my-first-game
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the local development environment:**

```bash
dubhe dev
```

This will:
- Start a local Sui network
- Deploy your contracts
- Start the development server

## Project Structure

Your new Dubhe project includes:

```
my-first-game/
├── contracts/          # Move smart contracts
├── client/             # Frontend application
├── schemas/            # ECS component definitions

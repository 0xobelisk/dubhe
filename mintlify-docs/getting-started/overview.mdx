## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Prerequisites">
    ```bash
    # Install Node.js 18+ and pnpm
    curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
    
    # Install Sui CLI (for Sui development)
    cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch mainnet sui
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Your First Project">
    ```bash
    pnpm create dubhe my-first-dapp
    cd my-first-dapp
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Development">
    ```bash
    # Start local blockchain
    pnpm run dev:node
    
    # In another terminal, deploy contracts
    pnpm run deploy:local
    
    # Start frontend
    pnpm run dev
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Success>
  **Congratulations!** 🎉 Your first Dubhe application is running at http://localhost:3000
</Success>

## 📚 Essential Concepts

<Accordion title="Entity Component System (ECS)">
  **What is ECS?**
  
  ECS is a software architecture pattern that separates data (Components) from logic (Systems) and uses Entities as unique identifiers. This pattern is widely used in game development for its performance and flexibility.
  
  **In Dubhe:**
  - **Entities**: Unique IDs representing objects in your application
  - **Components**: Data structures attached to entities (health, position, inventory)
  - **Systems**: Functions that process components and implement game logic
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Schema-Driven Development">
  **What are Schemas?**
  
  Schemas define the structure of your on-chain data. Dubhe uses these definitions to automatically generate:
  - Move smart contracts
  - TypeScript interfaces
  - Client SDK methods
  - Database indexes
  
  This ensures type safety from your smart contracts all the way to your frontend.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fully On-Chain Architecture">
  **What does "Fully On-Chain" mean?**
  
  In a fully on-chain application:
  - All game logic executes on the blockchain
  - All state is stored on-chain
  - Every action is verifiable and permanent
  - No centralized servers required
  
  This provides true ownership, composability, and persistence for your applications.
</Accordion>
